### 👋 Hi, I'm Raphael Idemetuk

I'm a **backend-focused engineer** passionate about building **scalable systems**, **automated workflows**, and **internal tools** that make operations smarter and more efficient.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- 🧠 **AI-powered automation** using LLMs, agents, and no-code/low-code tools
- 🛠️ **Backend engineering** with Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and Supabase
- 🔁 **Workflow orchestration** via n8n, Zapier, Make, and Airtable
- 🧱 **Data modeling** and API design for dynamic, operations-heavy platforms

Currently building tools and systems for:
- 🧪 **Credda** — an edtech ecosystem supporting upskilling across Africa  
- 🧠 **The Cave** — a tech-enabled community with reward systems and gamified ops  
- ⚙️ **Internal automation platforms** that save time, reduce manual work, and scale with clarity

💡 I’m especially interested in how backend systems and agentic workflows can be combined to power **smart, self-operating products** and streamline how businesses run.
